		<p>I have always had a passion for quality and productivity! This mentality was taught to me by very loving parents, who pushed us to accomplish difficult things. Even from a young age i felt like i could tackle tasks others around me deemed a waste of time, or "too difficult."
			<br />
		My transition into the world of computers has been gradual, and subconcious! I have been collecting and practicing with the tools needed for this career field without knowing the applications that were possible to me through web developement. 
		<br />
		I look forward to the life, and career I can obtain through this course, and the dedication i put into my work!
